            <h3>Members of the Coordinating Committee</h3>
            <h4>Aidan Cook</h4>
            <p>I got involved with DxE after hearing one of the founders speak at the 2015 Animal Rights Conference. I remember being struck by the bold vision and emphasis on historical evidence for successful social change. I’ve been organizing with the Colorado chapter since October of that year. Recently, I’ve been focused on promoting a culture of training among activists, becoming certified as a Kingian Nonviolence facilitator. Outside of DxE, I am a composer, interested in exploring ways that art can help address a community’s needs. I’m also a student of Zen Buddhism, and a long-term question which perplexes me is how our movement can tap into the spiritual drive that inspired people to sacrifice so much for the Civil Rights movement.</p>
            <h4>Ora Goldman</h4>
            <p>Ora Goldman has a passion towards understanding social systems and eliminating inhumane and unsustainable systems. Ora Goldman joined DxE in the summer of 2017 having become inspired by the dedication of the members and knowing that uprooting our treatment of animals is a fulcrum that will change almost everything about our society. She is a mother, accounting software developer, Mekorma business owner and founder of the non-profit 1 Act a Day.</p>
            <h4>Max Knight</h4>
            <p>Maximilian has been with the DxE Colorado chapter for over two years and participates in the Protest Working Group and the Coordinating Committee. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York and moved out to Colorado to study Environmental Engineering at CU Boulder. During his time with DxE Colorado Max has participated in countless disruptions, protests, vigils and a few open rescues. Max is also a founding organizer with the Denver Baby Animal Save.</p>
            <p>Outside of activism Max is interested in urban and vertical farming, developing sustainable food systems and providing clean water to communities in need.</p>
            <h4>Steven Rouk</h4>
            <p>I have two foundational goals that guide me: to live a good life, and to help others live good lives. Over the course of many years, I began to realize that if I wanted to truly make a difference in the lives of others, I needed to focus on all of the other animals we share the planet with—and especially the chickens, fish, pigs, and cows who are victims of unthinkable violence at the hands of humans. It's my goal to help humanity make as much progress ethically as we have technologically, building toward a much brighter future for us all and all who come after.</p>
            <p>In addition to my work with DxE Colorado, I'm also a data analyst with Mercy For Animals. I spend most of my free time running, reading, writing, and cooking.</p>
